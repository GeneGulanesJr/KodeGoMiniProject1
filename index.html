            <p>The history of video games began in the 1950s and 1960s as computer scientists began designing simple
                games and simulations on mainframe computers, with MIT's Spacewar! in 1962 as one of the first such
                games to be played with a video display. The early 1970s brought the first consumer-ready video game
                hardware: the first home video game console, the Magnavox Odyssey, and the first arcade video games,
                Computer Space and Pong, the latter which was later made into a home console version. Numerous companies
                sprang up to capture Pong's success in both the arcade and the home by creating clones of the game,
                causing series of boom and bust cycles due to oversaturation and lack of innovation. </p>

            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
                language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                follows
                most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason
                why it
                was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
            <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime
                system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                JavaScript has
                a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based
                model
                provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript
                also
                supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects,
                executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                classes,
                and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and
                you
                do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly
                typed.</p>

            <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
            <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
            <code>x = 42.</code>
            <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
                variant.</p>
            <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
            <code>let y = 13.</code>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>

            <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window,
                so
                you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
            <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or
                frame by
                specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a
                document,
                you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>

        <header>Constants</header>
        <article class="main-article">
            <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is
                the
                same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can
                contain
                alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
            <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
            <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has
                to be
                initialized to a value.</p>
            <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword
                is
                omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
            <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For
                example:
            </p>
            <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
                CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
                }</code>
            <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without
                problems.</p>
            <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code>

        <header>Data types</header>
        <article class="main-article">
            <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                        <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is
                            not the
                            same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.
                        </li>
                        <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                        <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                        <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                        <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                    </ul>

        <header>if...else statement</header>
        <article class="main-article">
            <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause
                to
                execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>
            <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
            <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what
                evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
                statement_2
                is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if
                statements.</p>
            <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as
                follows:</p>
            <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
                } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }</code>
            <p>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be
                executed.
                To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good
                practice
                to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:</p>
            <code>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code>
            <p>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be
                confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:</p>
            <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code>
            <p>If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional
                parentheses around the assignment. For example:</p>
            <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

        <article class="main-article">
            <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while
                statement looks as follows:</p>
            <code>while (condition) statement</code>
            <p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
                statement
                following the loop.</p>
            <p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true,
                statement
                is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
                control is
                passed to the statement following while.</p>
            <p>To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
            <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
            <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the
                following
                values:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.</p>

        <article class="main-article">
            <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the
                function
                keyword, followed by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The name of the function.</li>
                <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
                <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
            <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
            <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says
                to
                return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
                specifies the
                value returned by the function.</p>
            <code>return number * number;</code>
            <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the
                function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally
                or in
                the calling function.</p>
